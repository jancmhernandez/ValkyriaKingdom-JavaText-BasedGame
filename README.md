VALKYRIA KINGDOM
Developed by: Hernandez, Jan Cedric

The Valkyria Kingdom is a text-based and turn-based game featuring a sparring battle between two (2) elemental mages. With three available elements to specialize on, the user’s and bot’s characters can choose from four (4) offensive and three (3) defensive spells in every turn. The characters need to strategize to reduce the foe’s health points (HP) before their own HP level depletes. The players also need to consider how to maximize their mana point (MP) levels as these are the requirement to cast normal and elemental spells.

Refer to the documentation for more details.
